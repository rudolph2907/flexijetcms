# FlexiJetCMS

## IN PRORGRESS

API-First Open-source CMS with the idea of becoming a headless CMS working on NoSQL and SQL adapters.

Collections will be separated by entity.

- Data Adapters should be interchangeable (some features might not be available in all data adapters)
- An option should be available for adding data to a table that could take schema-less data.

Some tech in mind:

- MongoDB adapter
- Knex adapter
- Joi for schema validation
- Pub/sub Events for each step in managing content
- Adding middleware before and after managing content
- Have schema-less store
- API Key
- Data Relationships
- Generate Swagger UI from schema

Contributor, ideas and feedback welcome.
